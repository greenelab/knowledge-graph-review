### Unifying Techniques

Mapping high dimensional data into a low dimensional space has greatly improved modeling performance in fields such as natural language processing [@arxiv:1301.3781; @arxiv:1310.4546] and image analysis [@arxiv:1512.03385].
The success of these approaches provides rationale for projecting knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space as well [@arxiv:1709.05584].
Techniques that perform this projection often require information on how nodes are connected with one another [@raw:gongreplearn; @doi:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2606098; @raw:hanreplearn; @doi:10.1145/2806416.2806512], while other approaches can work directly with the edges themselves [@arxiv:1610.04073].
We group methods for producing low-dimensional representations of knowledge graphs into the following three categories: matrix factorization, translational methods, and deep learning.

#### Matrix Factorization

#### Translational Distance Models

Translational distance models treat edges in a knowledge graph as linear transformations.
As an example, one such algorithm, TransE [@raw:bordestranse], treats every node-edge pair as a triplet with head nodes represented as $\textbf{h}$, edges represented as $\textbf{r}$, and tail nodes represented as $\textbf{t}$.
These representations are combined into an equation that mimics the iconic word vectors translations ($\textbf{king} - \textbf{man} + \textbf{woman} \approx \textbf{queen}$) from the Word2vec model [@arxiv:1310.4546].
The equation is shown as follows: $\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$.
Starting at the head node ($\textbf{h}$), add the edge vector ($\textbf{r}$) and the result should be the tail node ($\textbf{t}$).
TransE optimizes embeddings for $\textbf{h}$, $\textbf{r}$, $\textbf{t}$, while guaranteeing the global equation ($\textbf{h} + \textbf{r} \approx \textbf{t}$) is satisfied [@raw:bordestranse].
A caveat to the TransE approach is that it the training steps force relationships to have a one to one mapping, which may not be appropriate for all types of relationships.

Wang et al. [@raw:wangtransH] attempted to resolve the one to one mapping issue by developing the TransH model.
TransH treats relations as hyperplanes rather than a regular vector and projects the head ($\textbf{h}$) and tail ($\textbf{t}$) nodes onto the hyperplane.
Following this projection, a distance vector ($\textbf{d}_{r}$) is calculated between the projected head and tail nodes.
Finally, each vector is optimized while preserving the global equation ($\textbf{h} + \textbf{d}_{r} \approx \textbf{t}$) [@raw:wangtransH].
Other approaches [@raw:lintransR, @arxiv:1610.04073; @arxiv:1909.00672] have built off of the TransE and TransH models. 
In the future, it may be beneficial for these models is to incorporate other types of information such as edge confidence scores, textual information, or edge type information when optimizing these embeddings.

### Unifying Applications

Knowledge graphs have been used in many biomedical applications ranging from identifying protein functions [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9] to prioritizing cancer genes [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148] to recommending safer drugs to patients [@arxiv:1710.05980; @doi:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011126].
In this section we discuss how knowledge graphs are being applied in biomedical settings. 
We put particular emphasis on an emerging set of techniques: those that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space.
