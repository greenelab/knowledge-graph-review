## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

Knowledge graphs can be used to aid researchers in finding novel information such as new drug applications [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726], predicting multicellular function from various tissue types [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx252] or even safe drug recommendaitons for patients [@arxiv:1710.05980].
Majority of these applications revolve around performing a network analysis task such as predicting the presence of a edge between two entites (link prediction), predicting the type of an unseen node in a network (node classification) or even suggest a group of nodes that relate to a query of interest (question and answering systems).
Initially, the first step before accomplishing the above task involves capturing and representing a network's structural information (e.g. node connectivity, edge types, node types).
This process is formally known as representation learning.
Methods within this category capture a network's structure by projecting nodes and possibly edges into a low dimensional space.
This space has numbers to represent a network's local and/or global strucutre.
We discuss various approaches used to project networks into a low dimensional space and also discuss applications that utilize this space to solve biomedical problems.
