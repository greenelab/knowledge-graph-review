## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

Knowledge graphs have been used to aid researchers in finding novel data.
For example, these resources have been used for finding new applcations to already FDA approved drugs [].
These novel findings arise from simple network approaches such as link prediction, which is the binary prediction that two entites share an edge together.
Many methods that perform link prediction utilize network structure to calculate the likelihood of link existence.
Recent approaches developed different techniques to project networks into a low dimensional space.
This space can capture local and global network structure in the form of dense vectors.
In this section we discuss various approaches to embed networks into a low dimensional space and applications that use these embeddings.
