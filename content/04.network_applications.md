## Applying Knowledge Graphs to Biomedical Challenges

Knowledge graphs can be used to aid researchers in executing important biomedical tasks such as finding new treatments for FDA approved drugs [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] and predicting protein function in human tissues [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx252].
Typically, the first step of these tasks involve modeling a knowledge graph's structural information (e.g., type of edges between nodes and how connected nodes are to each other).
This process is formally known as representation learning and methods within this category consist of projecting nodes and possibly edges into a low dimensional space.
This space represents a knowledge graph's local and/or global structure and is used to perform network analyses such as predicting the presence of an edge between two nodes (i.e., link prediction).
In this section, we discuss various techniques that project knowledge graphs into a low dimensional space and we also discuss applications that utilize this space to solve biomedical problems.
