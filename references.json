Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural\nmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be\njointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this\npaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in\nimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and\npropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for\nparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,\nwithout having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new\napproach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing\nstate-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French\ntranslation.

Recent research in the\nbroader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in\nautomating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present\nfeature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity\nof connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an\nalgorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes\nin networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional\nspace of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network\nneighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network\nneighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently\nexplores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is\nbased on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added\nflexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer\nrepresentations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing\nstate-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction\nin several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work\nrepresents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent\nrepresentations in complex networks.",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be\nsuperior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,\nincluding ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French\ntranslation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art\nBLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction\nof the training costs of the best models from the literature.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with\nhigh capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of\nlarge-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in\nrepresentation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of\nGPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant.\nWhat will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper\ntakes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the\nrelationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting\nthe JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we\ninvestigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this\ndata was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising\n(and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision\ntasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second,\nwe show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of\npromise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a\nbetter base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art\nresults for different vision tasks including image classification, object\ndetection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is\nthat this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop\ncollective efforts in building larger datasets.",

Our objective\nis a general system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in\nEMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial diagnosis, and\ntreatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient.\nMethods: We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and\nconstructed an EMR-based medical knowledge network (EMKN), in which nodes are\nentities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record. Three\nbipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each\ntask. One part of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and\nthe other was the condition to be inferred (e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was\nregarded as a Markov random field to support the inference. Three lazy energy\nfunctions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two\nknowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a\ndistributed representation of medical entities. Three measures were utilized\nfor performance evaluation. Results: On the initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of\nthe test records identified at least one correct disease from top 10\ncandidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%,\nrespectively. These results altogether indicate that the proposed system\noutperformed the baseline methods. The distributed representation of medical\nentities does reflect similarity relationships in regards to knowledge level.\nConclusion: Combining EMKN and MRF is an effective approach for general medical\nknowledge representation and inference. Different tasks, however, require\ndesigning their energy functions individually.",

Then, SMR jointly\nembeds diseases, medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a\nshared lower dimensional space. Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose\nthe medicine recommendation into a link prediction process while considering\nthe patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions.

Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we regard\nthe positive samples generated by the generator as the negative samples to\ntrain the discriminator. The optimal generator is obtained until the\ndiscrimination ability of the discriminator has the greatest decline. We adopt\nthe generator to filter distant supervision training dataset and redistribute\nthe false positive instances into the negative set, in which way to provide a\ncleaned dataset for relation classification. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed strategy significantly improves the performance of distant\nsupervision relation extraction comparing to state-of-the-art systems.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning provides new and powerful graph analytical approaches\nand tools for the highly valued data science challenge of mining knowledge\ngraphs. Since previous graph analytical methods have mostly focused on\nhomogeneous graphs, an important current challenge is extending this\nmethodology for richly heterogeneous graphs and knowledge domains. The\nbiomedical sciences are such a domain, reflecting the complexity of biology,\nwith entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes, and\nrelationships such as gene co-expression, biochemical regulation, and\nbiomolecular inhibition or activation. Therefore, the semantics of edges and\nnodes are critical for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real\nworld biomedical problems. In this paper, we propose the edge2vec model, which\nrepresents graphs considering edge semantics. An edge-type transition matrix is\ntrained by an Expectation-Maximization approach, and a stochastic gradient\ndescent model is employed to learn node embedding on a heterogeneous graph via\nthe trained transition matrix. edge2vec is validated on three biomedical domain\ntasks: biomedical entity classification, compound-gene bioactivity prediction,\nand biomedical information retrieval. Results show that by considering\nedge-types into node embedding learning in heterogeneous graphs,\n\\textbf{edge2vec}\\ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on all\nthree tasks. We propose this method for its added value relative to existing\ngraph analytical methodology, and in the real world context of biomedical\nknowledge discovery applicability.",

    "abstract": "The biomedical literature provides a rich source of knowledge such as\nprotein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and\nchemical-protein interactions (CPIs). Biomedical relation extraction aims to\nautomatically extract biomedical relations from biomedical text for various\nbiomedical research. State-of-the-art methods for biomedical relation\nextraction are primarily based on supervised machine learning and therefore\ndepend on (sufficient) labeled data. However, creating large sets of training\ndata is prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive, especially so in\nbiomedicine as domain knowledge is required. In contrast, there is a large\namount of unlabeled biomedical text available in PubMed. Hence, computational\nmethods capable of employing unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual\nannotation are of particular interest in biomedical relation extraction. We\npresent a novel semi-supervised approach based on variational autoencoder (VAE)\nfor biomedical relation extraction. Our model consists of the following three\nparts, a classifier, an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented\nusing multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the encoder and\ndecoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term memory\nnetworks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism\nallows our model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We\nevaluate our method on multiple public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental\nresults show that our method effectively exploits the unlabeled data to improve\nthe performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical)\nrelation extraction. Our results suggest that exploiting such unlabeled data\ncan be greatly beneficial to improved performance in various biomedical\nrelation extraction.",

    "abstract": "Effective modeling of electronic health records (EHR) is rapidly becoming an\nimportant topic in both academia and industry. A recent study showed that using\nthe graphical structure underlying EHR data (e.g. relationship between\ndiagnoses and treatments) improves the performance of prediction tasks such as\nheart failure prediction. However, EHR data do not always contain complete\nstructure information. Moreover, when it comes to claims data, structure\ninformation is completely unavailable to begin with. Under such circumstances,\ncan we still do better than just treating EHR data as a flat-structured\nbag-of-features? In this paper, we study the possibility of jointly learning\nthe hidden structure of EHR while performing supervised prediction tasks on EHR\ndata. Specifically, we discuss that Transformer is a suitable basis model to\nlearn the hidden EHR structure, and propose Graph Convolutional Transformer,\nwhich uses data statistics to guide the structure learning process. The\nproposed model consistently outperformed previous approaches empirically, on\nboth synthetic data and publicly available EHR data, for various prediction\ntasks such as graph reconstruction and readmission prediction, indicating that\nit can serve as an effective general-purpose representation learning algorithm\nfor EHR data.",

Computational approaches for prediction of drug–target interactions (DTIs) are highly desired in comparison to traditional experimental assays. Furthermore, recent advances of multiomics technologies and systems biology approaches have generated large-scale heterogeneous, biological networks, which offer unexpected opportunities for network-based identification of new molecular targets among known drugs.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In this study, we present a network-based computational framework, termed AOPEDF, an arbitrary-order proximity embedded deep forest approach, for prediction of DTIs. AOPEDF learns a low-dimensional vector representation of features that preserve arbitrary-order proximity from a highly integrated, heterogeneous biological network connecting drugs, targets (proteins) and diseases. In total, we construct a heterogeneous network by uniquely integrating 15 networks covering chemical, genomic, phenotypic and network profiles among drugs, proteins/targets and diseases. Then, we build a cascade deep forest classifier to infer new DTIs. Via systematic performance evaluation, AOPEDF achieves high accuracy in identifying molecular targets among known drugs on two external validation sets collected from DrugCentral [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.868] and ChEMBL (AUROC = 0.768) databases, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. In a case study, we showcase that multiple molecular targets predicted by AOPEDF are associated with mechanism-of-action of substance abuse disorder for several marketed drugs (such as aripiprazole, risperidone and haloperidol).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Source code and data can be downloaded from https://github.com/ChengF-Lab/AOPEDF.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease–gene and tissue–gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein–protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>CoCoScore is available at: https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

To date, most recent graph embedding methods are evaluated on social and information networks and are not comprehensively studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization (which can be seen as a type of graph embedding methods) have shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding methods (e.g. random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic comparison on 3 important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association (DDA) prediction, drug–drug interaction (DDI) prediction, protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction; and 2 node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods achieve promising results and deserve more attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Compared with three state-of-the-art methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any biological features and the learned embeddings can be treated as complementary representations for the biological features. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>As part of our contributions in the paper, we develop an easy-to-use Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, available at: https://github.com/xiangyue9607/BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

As big data continues to boom, there is a need to study a scalable, robust, and accurate solution that can process large heterogeneous datasets and yield valuable predictions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>We introduce a drug-target prediction method that improved our previously proposed method from the three aspects: 1) we constructed a heterogeneous network which incorporates 12 repositories and includes 7 types of biomedical entities (#20,119 entities, # 194,296 associations), 2) we enhanced the feature learning method with Node2Vec, a scalable state-of-art feature learning method, 3) we integrate the originally proposed inference-based model with a classification model, which is further fine-tuned by a negative sample selection algorithm. The proposed method shows a better result for drug–target association prediction: 95.3% AUC ROC score compared to the existing methods in the 10-fold cross-validation tests. We studied the biased learning/testing in the network-based pairwise prediction, and conclude a best training strategy. Finally, we conducted a disease specific prediction task based on 20 diseases. New drug-target associations were successfully predicted with AUC ROC in average, 97.2% (validated based on the DrugBank 5.1.0). The experiments showed the reliability of the proposed method in predicting novel drug-target associations for the disease treatment.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Gene prioritization is an important step for this endeavor to make a short manageable list from a list of thousands of genes coming from high-throughput studies. Network propagation methods are promising and state of the art methods for gene prioritization based on the premise that functionally-related genes tend to be close to each other in the biological networks.</jats:p><jats:p>In this study, we present PhenoGeneRanker, an improved version of a recently developed network propagation method called Random Walk with Restart on Multiplex Heterogeneous Networks (RWR-MH). PhenoGeneRanker allows multi-layer gene and disease networks. It also calculates empirical p-values of gene ranking using random stratified sampling of genes based on their connectivity degree in the network.</jats:p><jats:p>We ran PhenoGeneRanker using multi-omics datasets of rice to effectively prioritize the cold tolerance-related genes. We observed that top genes selected by PhenoGeneRanker were enriched in cold tolerance-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms whereas bottom ranked genes were enriched in general GO terms only. We also observed that top-ranked genes exhibited significant p-values suggesting that their rankings were independent of their degree in the network.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>CCS CONCEPTS</jats:title><jats:p>• Bioinformatics • Biological networks • System biology • Computational genomics</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title><jats:p>The source code is available on GitHub at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/bozdaglab/PhenoGeneRanker\">https://github.com/bozdaglab/PhenoGeneRanker</jats:ext-link> under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Contact</jats:title><jats:p><jats:email>cdursun@mcw.edu</jats:email> or <jats:email>serdar.bozdag@marquette.edu</jats:email></jats:p></jats:sec>",

These databases are populated via some form of manual curation, which is difficult to scale in the context of an increasing publication rate. Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to automatically annotate textual data. Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function. This makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible. We sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating the extent to which label functions could be re-used across multiple edge types. We used a subset of an existing knowledge graph centered on disease, compound, and gene entities to evaluate label function re-use. We determined the best label function combination by comparing a baseline database-only model with the same model but added edge-specific or edge-mismatch label functions. We confirmed that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation and shows that this approach can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph. We expect that continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.</jats:p>",

We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been rising interest in the discovery of novel drug indications because of high costs in introducing new drugs. Many computational techniques have been proposed to detect potential drug-disease associations based on the creation of explicit profiles of drugs and diseases, while seldom research takes advantage of the immense accumulation of interaction data. In this work, we propose a matrix factorization model based on known drug-disease associations to predict novel drug indications. In addition, genomic space is also integrated into our framework. The introduction of genomic space, which includes drug-gene interactions, disease-gene interactions, and gene-gene interactions, is aimed at providing molecular biological information for prediction of drug-disease associations. The rationality lies in our belief that association between drug and disease has its evidence in the interactome network of genes. Experiments show that the integration of genomic space is indeed effective. Drugs, diseases, and genes are described with feature vectors of the same dimension, which are retrieved from the interaction data. Then a matrix factorization model is set up to quantify the association between drugs and diseases. Finally, we use the matrix factorization model to predict novel indications for drugs.</jats:p>",

Experimental identification of miRNA-disease association is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to design efficient algorithms to identify novel miRNA-disease association. In this paper, we developed the computational method of Collaborative Matrix Factorization for miRNA-Disease Association prediction (CMFMDA) to identify potential miRNA-disease associations by integrating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and experimentally verified miRNA-disease associations. Experiments verified that CMFMDA achieves intended purpose and application values with its short consuming-time and high prediction accuracy. In addition, we used CMFMDA on Esophageal Neoplasms and Kidney Neoplasms to reveal their potential related miRNAs. As a result, 84% and 82% of top 50 predicted miRNA-disease pairs for these two diseases were confirmed by experiment. Not only this, but also CMFMDA could be applied to new diseases and new miRNAs without any known associations, which overcome the defects of many previous computational methods.</jats:p>",

The proposed model learns and optimises word embeddings based on the publicly available word vectors and also exploits position embeddings to identify the locations of the target protein names in sentences. Furthermore, it can employ various linguistic feature embeddings to improve the PPI extraction. The intensive experiments using AIMed data set known as the most difficult collection not only show the superiority of the suggested model but also indicate important implications in optimising the network parameters and hyperparameters. </jats:p>",

Existing approaches either do not customize based on patient health history, or ignore existing knowledge on drug-drug interactions (DDI) that might lead to adverse outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose the Graph Augmented Memory Networks (GAMENet), which integrates the drug-drug interactions knowledge graph by a memory module implemented as a graph convolutional networks, and models longitudinal patient records as the query. It is trained end-to-end to provide safe and personalized recommendation of medication combination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of GAMENet by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on real EHR data. GAMENet outperformed all baselines in all effectiveness measures, and also achieved 3.60% DDI rate reduction from existing EHR data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In discovering disease etiology and pathogenesis, the associations between MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases play a critical role. Given known miRNA-disease associations (MDAs), how to uncover potential MDAs is an important problem. To solve this problem, most of the existing methods regard known MDAs as positive samples and unknown ones as negative samples, and then predict possible MDAs by iteratively revising the negative samples. However, simply viewing unknown MDAs as negative samples introduces erroneous information, which may result in poor predication performance. To avoid such defects, we present a novel method using only positive samples to predict MDAs by latent features extraction (LFEMDA). We design a new approach to construct the miRNAs similarity matrix. LFEMDA integrates the disease similarity matrix, the known MDAs and the miRNAs similarity matrix to identify potential MDAs. By introducing miRNAs and diseases knowledge as the auxiliary variables, the method can converge to give the optimal solution in each iteration. We conduct experiments on high-association diseases and new diseases datasets, in which our method shows better performance than that of other methods. We also carry out a case study on breast neoplasms to further demonstrate the capacity of our method in uncovering potential MDAs.</jats:p>",

This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are relatively new computational tools that have found extensive utilization in solving many complex real-world problems. The attractiveness of ANNs comes from their remarkable information processing characteristics pertinent mainly to nonlinearity, high parallelism, fault and noise tolerance, and learning and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN-based computing (neurocomputing) and to serve as a useful companion practical guide and toolkit for the ANNs modeler along the course of ANN project development. The history of the evolution of neurocomputing and its relation to the field of neurobiology is briefly discussed. ANNs are compared to both expert systems and statistical regression and their advantages and limitations are outlined. A bird's eye review of the various types of ANNs and the related learning rules is presented, with special emphasis on backpropagation (BP) ANNs theory and design. A generalized methodology for developing successful ANNs projects from conceptualization, to design, to implementation, is described. The most common problems that BPANNs developers face during training are summarized in conjunction with possible causes and remedies. Finally, as a practical application, BPANNs were used to model the microbial growth curves of S. flexneri. The developed model was reasonably accurate in simulating both training and test time-dependent growth curves as affected by temperature and pH.",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been proposed for facilitating the uncovering of genes that underlie the pathology of different diseases. Some are purely statistical, resulting in a (mostly) undifferentiated set of genes that are differentially expressed (or co-expressed), while others seek to prioritize the resulting set of genes through comparison against specific known targets. Most of the recent approaches use either single data or knowledge sources, or combine the independent predictions from each source. However, given that multiple kinds of heterogeneous sources are potentially relevant for gene prioritization, each subject to different levels of noise and of varying reliability, each source bearing information not carried by another, we claim that an ideal prioritization method should provide ways to discern amongst them in a true integrative fashion that captures the subtleties of each, rather than using a simple combination of sources. Integration of multiple data for gene prioritization is thus more challenging than its single data type counterpart. What we propose is a novel, general, and flexible formulation that enables multi-source data integration for gene prioritization that maximizes the complementary nature of different data and knowledge sources in order to make the most use of the information content of aggregate data. Protein-protein interactions and Gene Ontology annotations were used as knowledge sources, together with assay-specific gene expression and genome-wide association data. Leave-one-out testing was performed using a known set of Alzheimer's Disease genes to validate our proposed method. We show that our proposed method performs better than the best multi-source gene prioritization systems currently published.",

    "abstract": "This article reports the use of the BioC standard format in our sentence simplification system, iSimp, and demonstrates its general utility. iSimp is designed to simplify complex sentences commonly found in the biomedical text, and has been shown to improve existing text mining applications that rely on the analysis of sentence structures. By adopting the BioC format, we aim to make iSimp readily interoperable with other applications in the biomedical domain. To examine the utility of iSimp in BioC, we implemented a rule-based relation extraction system that uses iSimp as a preprocessing module and BioC for data exchange. Evaluation on the training corpus of BioNLP-ST 2011 GENIA Event Extraction (GE) task showed that iSimp sentence simplification improved the recall by 3.2% without reducing precision. The iSimp simplification-annotated corpora, both our previously used corpus and the GE corpus in the current study, have been converted into the BioC format and made publicly available at the project's Web site: http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/isimp/.

Hospitals and medical centers are providing access to clinical data via clinical data warehouses such as i2b2, or Stanford's STRIDE database. In order to realize the potential of using these data for translational research, clinical data warehouses must be interoperable with standardized health terminologies, biomedical ontologies, and growing networks of Linked Open Data such as Bio2RDF. Applying the principles of Linked Data, we transformed a de-identified version of the STRIDE into a semantic clinical data warehouse containing visits, labs, diagnoses, prescriptions, and annotated clinical notes. We demonstrate the utility of this system though basic cohort selection, phenotypic profiling, and identification of disease genes. This work is significant in that it demonstrates the feasibility of using semantic web technologies to directly exploit existing biomedical ontologies and Linked Open Data. ",

    "abstract": "For over 50 years Mendelian Inheritance in Man has chronicled the collective knowledge of the field of medical genetics. It initially cataloged the known X-linked, autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inherited disorders, but grew to be the primary repository of curated information on both genes and genetic phenotypes and the relationships between them. Each phenotype and gene is given a separate entry assigned a stable, unique identifier. The entries contain structured summaries of new and important information based on expert review of the biomedical literature. OMIM.org provides interactive access to the knowledge repository, including genomic coordinate searches of the gene map, views of genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes in Phenotypic Series, and side-by-side comparisons of clinical synopses. OMIM.org also supports computational queries via a robust API. All entries have extensive targeted links to other genomic resources and additional references. Updates to OMIM can be found on the update list or followed through the MIMmatch service. Updated user guides and tutorials are available on the website. As of September 2018, OMIM had over 24,600 entries, and the OMIM Morbid Map Scorecard had 6,259 molecularized phenotypes connected to 3,961 genes.",
